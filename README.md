The goal is to count vehicles within a specific area in each frame to assess traffic density. This valuable data aids in identifying peak traffic periods, congested zones, and assists in urban planning. 

## Dataset
Training: 536 images
Validation: 90 images
Label: Contains YOLOv8 format labels 
standard input size of 640x640 pixels

## Setup
* * Load a pretrained YOLOv8n model from Ultralytics
* * The pre-trained model we've loaded is trained on the COCO dataset, which includes the 'car' and 'truck' classes among its 80 different categories â€” exactly what we need for our project
* * Perform inference on the provided image(s)
